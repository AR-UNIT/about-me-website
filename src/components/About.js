          I am currently a student at Northeastern University with a passion for distributed systems and software
          engineering. I bring professional experience from my time as a Software Engineer at Arcesium, where I
          optimized workflows by up to 40% and reduced compute resource usage significantly. I am excited to
          leverage my technical expertise in backend engineering roles.
          My graduate studies focus on distributed software systems implementation, with a keen interest in
          concurrency, parallelism, and distributed design patterns. I am driven by a commitment to solving
          complex challenges and making impactful contributions through technology.
